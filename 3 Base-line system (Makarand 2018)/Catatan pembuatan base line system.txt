*MATCHING*
For query pattern matching, edit distance and n-gram methods are used. 

Use of Euclidian distance and n-grams for pattern matching on compressed and noncompressed queries generated four possible alternatives as 
(1) Simple Euclidian distance. 
(2) Compressed Euclidian distance. 
(3) N-gram method. 
(4) Compressed n-gram method. 

For compressed queries, the original song patterns are also compressed for calculating distance measure. 

The cost of calculation for compressed queries is less but it eliminates the comparison of pattern with same successive notes.
